## Where the data comes from

R versions are built using the [evercran](https://github.com/r-lib/evercran)
project.

Results are found from running `ls(all.names = TRUE)` on all installed packages. 
For more details, see `guest-list-objects.R`.

The `Rversions` data frame lists versions of R and release dates.
