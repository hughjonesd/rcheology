# rcheology 4.3.2.0

* New data for R 4.3.2.
* New column `"priority"` records whether an object's package was `"base"` or 
  `"recommended"`.
* New column `"hidden"` simply records whether an object's name starts with `"."`
  (i.e. it is hidden from `ls()`).
* Column `"generic"` has been renamed to `"S4generic"`, to be more informative.
* Some data cleanups.
* Data is extended back to R version 0.50.


# rcheology 4.3.1.1

* Completely new build infrastructure using 
  [r-hub/evercran](https://github.com/r-hub/evercran).
  - Data is extended back to R version 0.62.3.
  - Recommended packages are now recorded.
  - Versions 2.15.1-w and 3.2.4-revised are now NOT recorded in the dataset.
  - Versions 3.0.1 and 3.0.3 ARE now recorded.
  - `last.warning` and `.Last.sys` are not recorded in the dataset for some
    R versions.
  - The class of `as.array` is recorded as `standardGeneric` rather than
    `function` in R 2.9.0 to 2.13.1.
  - Package `tcltk` is not recorded for 1.x versions. Working on a fix....
    
* Links in the Shiny app now go to hughjonesd/r-help, which provides help pages
  for all versions of R from 0.60 onwards.
