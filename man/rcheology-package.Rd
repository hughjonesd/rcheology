\title{Data on base packages from current and previous versions of R}
\description{
rcheology is a data package providing two data frames:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \link{rcheology} lists objects in all versions of R from 0.62.3 onwards.
\item \link{Rversions} lists R versions and their release dates. NB: For a more complete
and "canonical" solution, see the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=rversions}{rversions} package.
}

The version of the rcheology package reflects the latest R version to be included in the data,
e.g. 3.5.1.x contains data up to and including R 3.5.1.

An online app for data exploration is available at \url{https://hughjonesd.shinyapps.io/rcheology/}.

\subsection{Where the data comes from}{

R versions are built using the
\href{https://github.com/r-lib/evercran}{evercran} project.

Results are found from running \code{ls(all.names = TRUE)} on all installed
packages. For more details, see \code{guest-list-objects.R}.

The \code{Rversions} data frame lists versions of R and release dates.
}
}
\section{Limitations}{

\itemize{
\item Functions not built on the relevant platform - e.g. Windows functions - are not included.
\item Because data is collected using the original R version, it is subject to changes in the way
R works. For example, before 2.5.0, \code{\link[=args]{args()}} didn't work on \code{Primitive} functions, so
those functions have no value in the \code{args} column.
\item I have failed to build tcltk on R versions 1.0.1-1.4.1 and 1.7.0/1, so there's no
tcltk data for these versions. If you can help, get in touch.
